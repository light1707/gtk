/**
 * gsk_gl_buffer_new:
 * @target: the target buffer such as %GL_ARRAY_BUFFER or %GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER
 * @element_size: the size of elements within the buffer
 *
 * Creates a new #GskGLBuffer which can be used to deliver data to shaders
 * within a GLSL program. You can use this to store vertices such as with
 * %GL_ARRAY_BUFFER or uniform data with %GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.
 *
 * Note that only writing to this buffer is allowed (see %GL_WRITE_ONLY for
 * more details).
 *
 * The buffer will be bound to target upon returning from this function.
